# PHPGraphLib Graphing Library

### PHPGraphLib is a lightweight PHP-based graphing library that creates slick PHP graphs for incorporation into a website or application.

PHPGraphLib is a PHP 4+ friendly object-oriented class that has powerful customization features, allowing you to generate the perfect bar, line, stacked bar, or pie graph for any application. Used with dynamic data, PHPGraphLib allows easy visual interpretation of sophisticated data sets. Simply feed PHPGraphLib an array of data points, and it will generate a .png chart of your data.

### History

The first version PHPGraphLib was written in 2007 by Elliott Brueggeman to
deliver PHP generated graphs quickly and easily. It has grown in both features
and maturity since its inception, but remains PHP 4+ compatible. Originally
available only for paid commercial use, PHPGraphLib was open-sourced in 2013 
under the MIT License. Please visit [http://www.ebrueggeman.com/phpgraphlib](http://www.ebrueggeman.com/phpgraphlib)
