# Obsolete

Abandoned in favor of the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)/[Packagist](https://packagist.org) dependency management paradigm. Much of its functionality is replaced by [smtech/canvaspest](https://github.com/smtech/canvaspest) (object-oriented access to the Canvas API), [smtech/stmarks-bootstrapsmarty](https://github.com/smtech/stmarks-bootstrapsmarty) (page templating).

# SMCanvasLib

This branch contains code for working with the Canvas API, generating HTML pages (with supporting JavaScript, CSS and images). Basically, all the code that everything else depends on.

## Caveat Emptor

SMCanvasLib is going to get killed off and replaced by easier-to-manage [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) packages like [these](https://packagist.org/packages/smtech/). I'm still using it in a bunch of my active scripts, but I am unlikely to continue "maintaining" it into the 2015-2016 academic year.
